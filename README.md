## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Centering something is sometimes a pain, but flexbox is such a powerfull tool that helps most modern problems, applying flexbox to center this QR Code component has really made it easier. wonder what would have happend if not for flexbox.

Also with this project, I learnt markdown text, its so interesting in learning new stuff.

another topic that I dwelled on when I started this project is about, accessibility, and I am glad I could research a lot on it, before diving into my first solution

### Continued development

One thing that I constantly worry about is

- Best Practices.

and these best practises could be smarter codeflow, or accessibility. I wanna develop these skills mindfully.

### Useful resources

- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) - This helped me grasp what markdown is, and I higly recomend for people who dont know where to start. In the book that he provides, there's a website where you can practice, and that helped immensely.
- [Scrimba A11Y course](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-accessible-web-design-c031) - OH MY GOD, I didn't know such a platform existed for free users before i started my journey on Frontend Mentor, its by far the best learning platform I have untill now. its really great.
- [Frontend mentor's Learning Path](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths) - Guess I had to be thankful to this throughout solving, it really did mentor me.
